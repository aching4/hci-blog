While we were envisioning the game, we also considered incorporating a system to track progress. This was supported by many responses from both survey takers and people being interviewed. One interesting idea we also took into account from someone I interviewed was making the game multiplayer.

We gathered all of our interviews, grouped similar ideas together, and compared conflicting ideas to get a holistic view of what our potential users would prefer. While this did make us consider some new and unexplored areas, it ultimately gave us fresh perspectives and sparked ideas we hadn't thought of before.

Many times, I’ve also felt like the way math is taught to older students is very boring compared to how many different applications younger students have. This is why Mathified was created: to make sure that older students are also able to learn math in a more fun way. In this case, we are trying to make it more gamified. While the materials will still be difficult, having a little fun in between solving problems or solving problems in a way where students are able to engage a bit more and feel less like they are studying. There were a lot of abstract ideas of what could be potential solutions, but nothing concrete at the beginning. We first went through how we wanted the application to look itself and what functions we wanted it to do. A few thoughts at the beginning included the flow of how do we get into the game and how do we implement the game into also doing problems without making it feel like just doing homework. No initials ideas were completely discarded, but were built upon and tweaked to become better. I chose this as our final solution concept, playing games where solving problems completes the game, because it made sense to not fully distract from the solving problem, but we also wanted students to be able to have a bit of a break and feel like they were having fun. Our concept aligns with the research findings from Blog 2 because most people seem to like structured game levels, which we do have, as well as a little more exploration. So our first game idea was a maze.

We also noticed that lots of older students would want to see something similar but geared towards them. And by giving them this opportunity to feel more engaged with the content, I think it will ultimately benefit students who want to learn more difficult math without needing to stare at textbooks or listen to long lectures. We did test it on users, some feedback that we got included that while hints kept users motivated, they often relied on them too quickly, avoiding deeper thinking. Introducing a cooldown for a hint button could potentially encourage users to try solving problems first.

This builds the basics of the application as it points to what we will show on our screens first. Then I along with my team thought about an example games we could use. One of the first and simplest games we thought of was a maze where users can run around and grab keys/objects (to grab each, users would need to solve a math question). Once all keys/objects are gotten, users must get to the door and solve the final and hardest ones. I really like this idea because it easily scalable - it can adjust itself to have more or less objects to grab as well as include different challenges to get to each object, making it more interactive. Since I was so focused on the gameplay and how each thing connected to the next, I completely forgot about the different solutions that we would need to help users out, including the hint system, which made it into our second iteration of the prototype.

I actually really liked this idea because it personalizes it more which I think users prefer. At the beginning there were some issues with the linking of the pages, but that ended up getting fixed.

But, it has taught me to always look for more areas to think through designs as well as pretend to be the user.

I was very excited to be able to imagine how to make this application a reality, but I was also intimidated by all the designing that goes on within making this application. The one thing that stands out to me in UI design principles is consistency within the whole site. I've noticed other sites where some pages don't match previously and it makes the whole site seem unprofessional and harder to continue to look through. It made me unsure if each page was the right next page. I want to avoid this issue, which is why I want to focus a lot of my time on making all components consistent.

Usability flaws that we came up with for our medium-fidelity project was not having enough consistency in the button placement.

There are some things that chatgpt and AI is not very good at and people ended up being better at.

However, I do think at one point, it can start to complicate the process of user-centered design. Since as humans, we understand our peers better than AI can analyze. I think AI tools can understand human behaviors enough to create a design that some people may like. However, I think it will take a while to train and it will have biases. AI tools, however, are very flexible with their design, which may be a plus. As of right now, AI tools, in my opinion, cannot truly create something that is empathetic and user-friendly. But, in the future there is always that possibility. I think AI can change the future of HCI design by giving a good head start to get a decent baseline and humans can come in a adjust as necessary.

Over-reliance on AI can make designs feel to flat and unattractive to people. It can also make designs start to reduce its uniqueness and everything will be very similar. I think one of the biggest things to keep in mind is that continuous check ins and actively checking out what the AI results shouldensure that human intuition and empathy are not lost in the process. I think AI can actually mess up collaboration within design team, especially if colleagues don't agree with how to use AI in their projects.
