It pushes me out of my comfort zone so that I can envision what others focus on and what they value."}),null),e})()]}const to="/hci-blog/assets/flow1-1PTwt7pC.png",no="/hci-blog/assets/flow2-yl3PRrsL.png",oo="/hci-blog/assets/game-CstdIke-.jpg";var io=$('<div class="space-y-2 mt-4">');function so(){return[d(J,{children:"My Journey Pt. 4"}),(()=>{var e=io();return p(e,d(v,{img:{src:oo,direction:"left"},children:"The first version of our prototype was a very rough sketch of just the run through of how Mathified work. We essentially attempted to build how each page would look and what would need to be on there. To do this, I mainly looked into what specific information we would need from the user: like what branch, any specific focus areas, and what games mode/type they would like to use. This builds the basics of the application as it points to what we will show on our screens first. Then I along with my team thought about an example games we could use. One of the first and simplest games we thought of was a maze where users can run around and grab keys/objects (to grab each, users would need to solve a math question). Once all keys/objects are gotten, users must get to the door and solve the final and hardest ones. I really like this idea because it easily scalable - it can adjust itself to have more or less objects to grab as well as include different challenges to get to each object, making it more interactive. Since I was so focused on the gameplay and how each thing connected to the next, I completely forgot about the different solutions that we would need to help users out, including the hint system, which made it into our second iteration of the prototype. All of this was mostly done on paper and then prototyped to move to different areas based off of figma interactions. The figma interactions took a while to perfect."}),null),p(e,d(v,{img:{src:to,direction:"right"},children:"We ended up testing the prototype on some people who did not know what Mathified was and got some interesting feedback. One of them was adding colors to indicate if a user has already worked on it or what level they are at. For example, red means you aren't at that level, yellow means you are working on it, and green means you are good with those concepts. I actually really liked this idea because it personalizes it more which I think users prefer. At the beginning there were some issues with the linking of the pages, but that ended up getting fixed. There were not big issues, but I was surprised by how the figma prototype has started to really help me picture how the application is supposed to look and the flow of how each thing connects to another."}),null),p(e,d(v,{img:{src:no,direction:"left"},children:"One big thing I ended up missing was the hint system and the step by step guide that shows you a similar problem. I think I missed this because I got too wrapped up in trying to get the flow correct that I missed details. I also had some other smaller fixes that was suggested but was not important since they were more geared towards making the application look nicer. The prototype at the end had better flow and included a little more features compared to the first one. I learned that most of the time people will miss things and focus on areas that may not be the most important. But, it has taught me to always look for more areas to think through designs as well as pretend to be the user. The design was not as hard as I imagined it to be but there were challenges in deciding which things to put first. There was a lot of back and forth on the pros and cons of each side."}),null),p(e,d(v,{children:"Overall, the most challenging part of rapid prototyping is seeing the bigger picture when drawing out each section. Since you only see the section you are on and the previous one, it is very easy to get lost on what needs to happen next. I enjoyed being able to start picturing how the end result will look like and create the bigger picture view that often gets overlooked. It was also very rewarding being able to see the prototype come to life and just to the next area. One advice I would give is to make sure that when people are putting pictures into figma, they need to ensure that the sizing fits with the screens.

At first, it was both exciting and intimidating. I was very excited to be able to imagine how to make this application a reality, but I was also intimidated by all the designing that goes on within making this application. The one thing that stands out to me in UI design principles is consistency within the whole site. I've noticed other sites where some pages don't match previously and it makes the whole site seem unprofessional and harder to continue to look through. It made me unsure if each page was the right next page. I want to avoid this issue, which is why I want to focus a lot of my time on making all components consistent.

Even though we wanted it unique, we also prioritized comfortablilty of the eyes and what would have the best feel for users. We are still a bit indecisive on how the game parts should look, mostly because we want to balance our design with how normal games would look. None of the feedback changed the design drastically.

I think now I have started to appreciate more the intuitive designing that needs to encompass everyone rather than just someone who already understands what it should be doing.

The other thing that needs to be is the visibility of system status. I think the most difficult part to be addressed is helping users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors because you would need to step into the users shoes, but all designers have a harder time being able to find what could be pain points in their own designs. Usability flaws that we came up with for our medium-fidelity project was not having enough consistency in the button placement.

I ended up balancing aesthetic choices with ease of use by making sure the aesthetics were close to other websites but also stood out as a bit different. This helped with the usability of it too because we are able to use a lot of designs that end up being intuitive for users, making users have less questions for that particular section. Some things that we improved on for this prototype were in accordance with heuristic evaluation. One big thing that is not there in the medium-fidelity prototype is the visibility of the user system.

Some user flows were also re-considered and added onto. One of the biggest things I've noticed for UI/UX is that when you design something, the more invisible some of the parts are the better they are. Another thing that was unexpected was that people don't actually appreciate some of the finer details that you make. Instead, thye take things to the point and many shortcuts will be taken.

Users are a lot more outcome oriented, which designers will need to balance with their creative freedom.

It also had premade layouts that were useful for us to get started. In the presentation deck, we decided to put those things because it was the things that stood out most in our prototype. We organized it in accordance with what was given. We decided this was the best way to present it because it had a great flow where the ending of one topic can lead into the next section. Storytelling did not play too big of a part in both the website and slide deck. While we wanted everything to flow nicely, we did not have any specific storytelling idea. One way we made sure our audience could easily follow the design journey was to separate all the different areas and make different tabs that showed our process, the user research we did, and all the prototypes we did.

For research findings, a lot of the research ended up being done on potential users. However, all of our schedules clashed with a lot of the users we wanted to keep getting feedback from. So that made us resort to using online feedback, which strained our schedule a bit and made us do some things a little later than expected.

I made sure the presentation deck and website showcased the full scope of the project by highlighting the parts where we made the most changes and all the challenges that we had. The value of our design was shown through the user feedback and testing. The color matching of the website to the background purple took a bit of time.

Presenting my work forces me to not only know it inside and out, but it also forces me to structure all of the information into digestible pieces. It can be quite challenging but it definitely allowed me to explore designs of other websites and try for the things that others have implemented. I learned that communicating design ideas to non-designers can be quite different and there is a lot of catch up to do. When others are trying to understand certain points, sometimes it can be hard to figure out where to start explaining it. If I explain something that is too advanced, it confuses them, but starting out too easy makes it so that the other person wants to skip over most of the things, that makes it more likely for them to miss the actual information they need.
