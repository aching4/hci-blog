          I approached making and designing the portfolio website by going with
          simplistic and classy aesthetics. I felt that a website with too many
          designs would make it feel too much since we are already doing this to
          showcase our prototype, which can be quite a complicated process in
          itself. We used google sites for our website mostly because it was
          easily accessible and we can focus on the visual aspect but not the
          coding part. It also had premade layouts that were useful for us to
          get started. In the presentation deck, we decided to put those things
          because it was the things that stood out most in our prototype. We
          organized it in accordance with what was given. We decided this was
          the best way to present it because it had a great flow where the
          ending of one topic can lead into the next section. Storytelling did
          not play too big of a part in both the website and slide deck. While
          we wanted everything to flow nicely, we did not have any specific
          storytelling idea. One way we made sure our audience could easily
          follow the design journey was to separate all the different areas and
          make different tabs that showed our process, the user research we did,
          and all the prototypes we did. We also put more descriptions of each
          section we worked on for users to get a better idea of each process as
          well as different links that show the progression from start to
          finish.

          Some challenges I faced when presenting my design decisions was
          figuring out a way to make the design fresh yet creative. I wanted the
          design to mimic a lot of the other prototypes without being too
          boring. By using a different color that is not commonly used in other
          websites, it helps it stand out without making the design more
          complicated or challenging for users. For research findings, a lot of
          the research ended up being done on potential users. However, all of
          our schedules clashed with a lot of the users we wanted to keep
          getting feedback from. So that made us resort to using online
          feedback, which strained our schedule a bit and made us do some things
          a little later than expected. I decided to highlight the prototyping
          part because it shows us our process quite clearly as well as show our
          progression in what direction we went in. I made sure the presentation
          deck and website showcased the full scope of the project by
          highlighting the parts where we made the most changes and all the
          challenges that we had. The value of our design was shown through the
          user feedback and testing. The color matching of the website to the
          background purple took a bit of time. It was very hard to match the
          button colors to not only the website colors, but also make it stand
          out. I presented them in the portfolio by showing the design
          progression from low-fidelity to hi-fidelity prototypes.

          I learned to highlight both the challenges as well as what we are
          proud of through the portfolio and slide deck. In the portfolio, we
          tried to highlight the prototypes since that is what our working
          design would look like if it was a website application. In the slide
          deck, we highlighted a little bit more of our process and challenges.
          As of right now, we did not present it to the class, but I hope that
          our work was perceived as helpful. I think I will communicate all
          design decisions and research behind it in a clear and engaging way by
          showing the different ways to be able to play through a game in
          Mathified. I write it in a way where I seem like I am conversing with
          others and making a decision why and why not I make certain decisions.
          I think if I could present again, I would try to include a bit more
          storytelling and try to talk more about the detailed process without
          being too wordy.

          Building a portfolio and presenting my work helped me realize how much
          easier it is to critique others' work and how much work goes into just
          making all the UI consistently nice but also making it interesting. It
          takes a lot longer than I expected to finalize a design because there
          was always something I wanted to change. Presenting my work forces me
          to not only know it inside and out, but it also forces me to structure
          all of the information into digestible pieces. It can be quite
          challenging but it definitely allowed me to explore designs of other
          websites and try for the things that others have implemented. I
          learned that communicating design ideas to non-designers can be quite
          different and there is a lot of catch up to do. When others are trying
          to understand certain points, sometimes it can be hard to figure out
          where to start explaining it. If I explain something that is too
          advanced, it confuses them, but starting out too easy makes it so that
          the other person wants to skip over most of the things, that makes it
          more likely for them to miss the actual information they need. I will
          use presentation skills in my future career whenever I would need to
          make a presentation for anything.
