          I actually did not really use AI tools when doing my HCI design process. 
          Most of the design process comes from trial and error of what looks good 
          and what doesn't look good. Most of the time, we used AI (chatgpt) to 
          streamline and improve my workflow by having chatgpt look through spelling 
          or grammar errors as well as at the very beginning, come up with a few 
          ideas on what we could be doing the project about. It really was just 
          giving us general ideas and small corrections that we took and used. 
          Other than what was already mentioned, we used AI to help us make some 
          questions sound nicer and more professional as well as give us a general 
          idea of how certain things can be structured. Specifically, its ability 
          to change our ideas or simple requests into more fleshed out and nicer 
          sounding text makes it a lot easier to finish things quickly. It helps 
          speed up the process of finding the right words as well as doing more 
          peer review than necessary to try to catch spelling or grammar errors.

          An AI hack that i discovered that significantly improved my design and 
          process was ways to word certain prompts to get a better answer. For 
          example, simple short phrases as well as writing what you want and 
          giving followup information helps a lot. It significantly helped me get 
          the ideas and results that I wanted on the first go rather than going 
          through multiple iterations of asking and answering from chatgpt. I did 
          not discover any unexpected AI capabilities that made my design more 
          intuitive or userfriendly. Our design (the game) was a little too involved 
          for AI to be super useful, but I can see how integrating AI into our 
          application would make it a lot better and helpful for students. There 
          were not much AI-generated insights that led to important design decisions 
          that we haven't already thought of. Most of the uses was to flush it out a 
          bit more or reorganize our thoughts.

          I think using AI in the design process can be pretty helpful, especially 
          for coming up with initial ideas, but for further into the development 
          it is a lot less useful. AI is nice as an idea creator as well as thinking 
          in a different perspective, but I think at some point, it ends up distracting 
          from true design thinking. There are some things that chatgpt and AI is not 
          very good at and people ended up being better at. AI definitely does enhance 
          the process of user-centered design because it can point out areas that us as 
          humans may not be as aware of since it is able to pull from such a big database 
          of sources and materials. However, I do think at one point, it can start to 
          complicate the process of user-centered design. Since as humans, we understand 
          our peers better than AI can analyze. I think AI tools can understand human 
          behaviors enough to create a design that some people may like. However, I think 
          it will take a while to train and it will have biases. AI tools, however, are 
          very flexible with their design, which may be a plus. As of right now, AI tools, 
          in my opinion, cannot truly create something that is empathetic and user-friendly. 
          But, in the future there is always that possibility. I think AI can change the 
          future of HCI design by giving a good head start to get a decent baseline and 
          humans can come in a adjust as necessary. With AI being very popular in the 
          industry, I think it will also play a central role in the future HCI processes.

        <Paragraph>
          AI offers a lot of advantages in HCI design like faster prototyping and quickly 
          giving basic things, but it can limit creativity and overlook human nuances. As 
          stated before, balancing AI with human-centered design can be very rewarding. 
          However, it is easiest to use AI as a baseline and introduction to what the design 
          could be, then have humans go through those and make them more user-friendly and 
          usable. Over-reliance on AI can make designs feel to flat and unattractive to 
          people. It can also make designs start to reduce its uniqueness and everything 
          will be very similar. I think one of the biggest things to keep in mind is that 
          continuous check ins and actively checking out what the AI results shouldensure 
          that human intuition and empathy are not lost in the process. I think AI can 
          actually mess up collaboration within design team, especially if colleagues 
          don't agree with how to use AI in their projects. But it does also help facilitate 
          communication on what is expected from the AI versus the designers. If not managed 
          well, it may create silos and reduce meaningful human interaction.
