          Reflecting on my journey through the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) 
          course, I can honestly say it has been very eye-opening experience 
          because there were so many things that I learned and had change my 
          view on what it was like. When I first entered the course, I thought 
          HCI was mostly about making interfaces look good or organizing 
          elements on a screen. But from day one, it became clear that HCI is 
          not just aesthetics, but about understanding people, anticipating 
          their needs, and designing technology that fits seamlessly into their 
          lives.

          As the course evolved, so did my mindset. In the beginning, I was focused 
          on getting things right, trying to design everything fully and come up 
          with very unique features. Over time, I realized that success in HCI 
          isn't about perfection, it's about iteration, feedback, and being open 
          to change. The best part of HCI lies in testing assumptions, learning 
          from users, and improving designs based on real human behavior. The biggest 
          lesson that I learned was the shift in thinking for what I would like for 
          myself to what would others or the majority like and enjoy. There were 
          definitely surprises along the way. One of the biggest was how long the 
          design process could be. I started with just a basic design and kept changing 
          different aspects after feeling like it didn't fit correctly. Being very 
          specific on how colors looked and interacted with different areas of the 
          page made the process take a lot longer than finishing a design and trying 
          to change it slightly to fit certain requirements or preferences. Another 
          surprising thing that I didn't realize i needed to consider was how much 
          psychology and behavioral science played a role in design. Understanding 
          cognitive load and how people perceive information changed the way I will 
          now approach projects.

          There were challenging moments, too. Conducting user research was more 
          difficult than I expected. It took lots of time, patience, and careful 
          planning to gather meaningful insights. Sometimes, users say things that 
          contradict what you were expecting or hoping for, and it forces you to go 
          back to the drawing board. It was tough at first, but I eventually learned 
          to embrace that discomfort. On the other hand, some of the best moments 
          came when a prototype finally got to the point where both us designers 
          and users liked it. If I were writing a letter to someone about to start 
          their HCI journey, I'd tell them this: approach the course with an open 
          mind, and let go of the need to be perfect from the start. HCI is a process 
          of discovery, not just execution. Be willing to explore different methods, 
          even if they feel like the wrong choice. Interview people, sketch ideas, 
          test messy prototypes and don't be afraid to make mistakes or feel stuck. 
          I'd also tell future students to treat feedback as a gift. Whether it's from 
          instructors, peers, or users, every piece of feedback is an opportunity to 
          improve. Finally, remember that empathy is the heart of HCI. The most 
          successful designers aren't just technically skilledâ€”they genuinely care 
          about the people they're designing for.

          Looking ahead, this course has already influenced how I think about my 
          future career. Whether I pursue work in design, development, or research, 
          I now carry a user-first mindset with me. I'm more attentive to 
          accessibility, more curious about how people interact with technology, 
          and more committed to creating solutions that are both functional and 
          meaningful. HCI has shown me that design is not just about building things, 
          it's about building the right things, in the right way, for the right people.
