        <Paragraph>
          I’ve noticed that a lot of students, especially students who are 
          in more difficult math classes, struggle with learning math and 
          end up feeling very discouraged about continuing to learn math. 
          Many times, I’ve also felt like the way math is taught to older 
          students is very boring compared to how many different applications 
          younger students have. This is why Mathified was created: to make 
          sure that older students are also able to learn math in a more fun 
          way. In this case, we are trying to make it more gamified. While the 
          materials will still be difficult, having a little fun in between 
          solving problems or solving problems in a way where students are able 
          to engage a bit more and feel less like they are studying. There were 
          a lot of abstract ideas of what could be potential solutions, but 
          nothing concrete at the beginning. We first went through how we wanted 
          the application to look itself and what functions we wanted it to do. 
          A few thoughts at the beginning included the flow of how do we get into 
          the game and how do we implement the game into also doing problems 
          without making it feel like just doing homework. No initials ideas were 
          completely discarded, but were built upon and tweaked to become better. 
          I chose this as our final solution concept, playing games where solving 
          problems completes the game, because it made sense to not fully distract 
          from the solving problem, but we also wanted students to be able to have 
          a bit of a break and feel like they were having fun. Our concept aligns 
          with the research findings from Blog 2 because most people seem to like 
          structured game levels, which we do have, as well as a little more 
          exploration. So our first game idea was a maze. Each maze can be structured 
          while allowing students to explore different areas, fulfilling both requirements.

          Shooting the concept video was quite difficult. All of our schedule did not 
          align, so we had to do a lot of the prep online. We essentially made sure 
          to have a general script of what we wanted and made up some fake questions 
          to show how the application would work. One of bigger issues that we faced 
          was getting things to show without glare. We had lights pointed at different 
          areas and while it did light the place well, it made it hard to see things 
          that we sometimes needed to show the audience.

          The target users are middle schoolers, high schoolers, college schoolers, 
          and working professionals who want to brush up on their math skills. Middle 
          schoolers and working professionals will be the outliers while, realistically, 
          most of our users will be in high school or college schoolers. It enhances 
          their lives because now people can try something that worked very well for 
          younger students. We also noticed that lots of older students would want to see 
          something similar but geared towards them. And by giving them this opportunity 
          to feel more engaged with the content, I think it will ultimately benefit 
          students who want to learn more difficult math without needing to stare at 
          textbooks or listen to long lectures. We did test it on users, some feedback 
          that we got included that while hints kept users motivated, they often relied on 
          them too quickly, avoiding deeper thinking. Introducing a cooldown for a hint 
          button could potentially encourage users to try solving problems first. Also I 
          noticed similar examples helped users learn problem-solving steps but offered 
          limited transference of knowledge to different problems. So, adding step-by-step 
          explanations could improve conceptual understanding.
