      <h3>About Me</h3>

          Hi! My name is Ashley. I like to sketch and do digital art, which
          definitely drew me to this area that heavily examines humans reactions
          and feelings on designs in an applications. I started in computer
          science just exploring all the topics within to see which ones
          intrigues me. One aspect that has caught my attention for a while is
          the design decisions of different applications. I'm sure you've
          experienced, as I have, many designs that are loved and hated.
        </p>

      <p>
        Some sites have so much information on their page that can overwhelm
        users as well as very slow load times that will frustrate users because
        they just can't load the pages. On the other hand, I've some amazing
        designs where navigation is clear and easy to use. Plus, everything on
        the page is engaging and makes people want to continue to explore and
        use.
      </p>
      <p>
        This led me to learn more about how humans interact with different
        platforms as well as the difference between the design idea/process of
        products that are intuitive to use and ones that feel frustrating to
        use.
      </p>
      <h3>HCI (Human Computer Interaction)</h3>
      <p>
        Human computer interaction and UI/UX may sound like words that people in
        tech may just throw around. In reality, it is very important to
        understand the nuances of this field because it impacts how we interact
        technology on a daily basis. It creates a smoother and more welcoming
        experience that we all tend to take for granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few things I've discovered to have a huge impact on how a person feels
        about a platform is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          How easy it is to use for someone who has never explored this
          technology (example: clear controls, intuitively know where to click)
        </li>
        <li>
          How accessible information like being easy to read, easy to navigate
          throughout
        </li>
        <li>
          How designs like buttons, icons, colors, and the layout of the page
          cohesively looks
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <img class="image-wrap-left" src="assets/notion.png" width="256" />
        An example of one that has made a positive impact in my life is Notion,
        a task management application. The clean and clear visual navigation and
        design helps me stay organized and keep track of my work without making
        it feel cluttered and disorganized. Its guided customizabiltiy of
        layouts and creating reminders helps make even a new user comfortable
        with interacting with it as well as saving time because it has included
        features that reduce the number of applications needed and cuts out the
        step of transferring information to a new application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smartphones's touch screen is another helpful tool that has saved users
        time and effort. Its easy motions of swiping and tapping makes it an
        easy thing to learn no matter how well you know technology. The ability
        to easily find applications that is arranged in a organized but
        aesthetic way engages users while making it convenient plays a big
        factor on why it's so popular nowadays.
      </p>

        Google suites has also made a positive difference in my life. Its
        collaboration feature made working on projects for classes much easier.
        Its clear share button plus multiple areas to access collaborative tools
        allows for users to more easily find and use these features. Its real
        time editing with collaborators and real-time notifications make working
        together less stressful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human computer interaction has helped me become better because it has
        allowed me to take a break from the stresses of doing things manually
        and giving me tools that make it easy for me to do the boring and
        tedious tasks of my everyday life.
      </p>
      <h3>My Project</h3>
      <p>
        This semester, my group and I are working on a project to add to HCI
        knowledge and provide a prototype of an idea that can help students who
        may feel like more advanced math is very difficult and feel unmotivated
        to continue learning it.
      </p>
      <p>Some problems that normally kills a student's motivation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Don't know how to approach a problem when given one</li>
        <li>
          Aren't familiar with how to solve problems in a specific area in math.
        </li>
        <li>Have difficulty recalling formulas or how/when to apply them.</li>
        <li>Wants more practice with solutions available + feedback.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <img class="image-wrap-right" src="assets/math.png" width="256" />
        While there are already many app/websites for younger kids to solve this
        issue, older students in more advanced classes lack materials and
        platforms that are interactive and stimulating. Tutoring, textbooks, and
        videos help, but they often don't provide the engagement needed to
        sustain the motivation to keep learning even when they cannot figure out
        a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        To combat these issues, we are planning on creating a gamified math
        application specifically geared towards higher levels of math - Algebra
        through Calculus.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this application, users will be able to choose which branches of math
        and topics they are trying learn or study for. At the beginning, users
        will have the option to go through a step-by-step guided example of
        solving that type of problem. Later, users are able to choose how they
        would like to solve problems and learn this topic.
